The Mouse Immune Phenotyping Panel offers 8 distinct markers that enable identification of lymphoid and myeloid immune cell infiltrates in tumors. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8) and helper T cells (CD4) can be detected amongst the total immune cell infiltrates in NSCLC. While B cells were not observed in NSCLC, MHC class II expression delineates antigen-presenting cells in NSCLC, and macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and neutrophils can be detected by expression of F4/80, CD11b, and Ly-6G in NSCLC.", "Arrows": [], "Overlays": [], "Group": "Mouse Immune Phenotyping Panel", "Masks": [], "ActiveMasks": [], "Zoom": 0.45597656249999996, "Pan": [0.5000000000000019, 0.3915729355002917]}, {"Name": "Mouse Cancer Cell PRocess Panel", "Description": "Tumors exhibit heterogenous phenotypes due to clonal evolution of cancer cells during tumorigenesis. Each cancer stem cell-derived population has a unique molecular signature that fine-tunes cellular processes. The Mouse Cancer Cell Process Panel reveals signaling pathway activation, proliferation, metabolism, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), thus highlighting the variety of cancerous cell processes in the mouse TME.\n\nRas signaling modulates growth rate and metastasis of tumors and initiates upon activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which phosphorylate tyrosine residues (pTyr) on signaling receptors. Subsequent activation of the phospho-relay pathway results in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1 and ERK2 (pERK1/2). The Mouse Cancer Cell Process Panel offers pTyr and pERK1/2 markers for assessment of canonical and non-canonical Ras signaling. In NSCLC, elevated levels of pTyr and pERK1/2 in cells indicates activation of Ras signaling.\n\nTumors rely on a constant supply of nutrients for sustained growth, made possible by constitutive activation of glycolytic metabolism21. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) is a step in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade that regulates metabolic activity in cells22. Ki-67 is an exclusive nuclear marker for proliferating cells that is present at all active stages of the cell cycle23. The Mouse Cancer Cell Process Panel offers both pS6 and Ki-67 markers for the assessment of metabolic activity and tumor growth. InNSCLC, cells with individual and concomitant expression of pS6 and Ki-67 can be detected, indicating metabolic and growth capacity of tissues.\n\nEMT is linked to promoting cancer morbidity by contributing to tumor initiation, invasion, and resistance to therapeutic interventions. During EMT, tumor cells disrupt cell-cell adhesions and activate pro-migratory cellular machinery. The Mouse Cancer Cell Process Panel includes 6 markers for assessing cellular processes associated with EMT. In normal lung tissue and NSCLC, high overlapping expression of cell-cell adhesion molecules, E-cadherin (E-cad), \u03b2-catenin (\u03b2-cat), and EpCAM highlight epithelial cells with suppressed EMT activation. Expression of cytoskeletal components vimentin (Vim) and \u03b2-actin (\u03b2-act) identifies cells with activated migratory capabilities in NSCLC tissue.
